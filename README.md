## Introduction
#### Problem Statement

#### Background

#### Literature Review

#### Motivations
<p>This research is driven by several gaps in the existing literature regarding cross-partisan dialogue and its potential for reducing political polarization. While prior studies demonstrate that brief cross-partisan interactions can temporarily reduce affective polarization (e.g., dislike of political out-groups), these effects often diminish over time. For instance, Rossiter and Carlson (2024) found that short conversations between Republicans and Democrats reduced polarization immediately after the contentious 2020 U.S. election, but noted that these effects were not sustained long-term (p. 1610). Similarly, De Jong (2024) highlighted that cross-partisan discussions among UK voters reduced polarization, though less effectively when participants disagreed on divisive issues, suggesting limitations in one-off interventions. To address these shortcomings, this study tests whether sustained engagement—through biweekly discussions over three months—can produce more durable depolarization effects.  </p>
<p>Another motivation stems from the role of moderation in facilitating productive dialogue. Previous studies have shown that unmoderated discussions often lead to conflict or reinforce existing divisions, particularly when contentious topics are discussed (Santoro &amp; Broockman, 2022). Moderated discussions, however, create a safer environment for participants to engage in meaningful conversations by establishing norms of mutual respect and active listening (Santoro &amp; Broockman, 2022). This study incorporates professional facilitation to guide discussions and mitigate risks of adversarial interactions.  </p>
<p>Finally, most prior research focuses on reducing affective polarization but neglects other dimensions of polarization, such as ideological rigidity or behavioral spillover effects. For example, Fang et al. (2025) found that in-person conversations reduced animosity but did not examine whether participants became more open to revising their policy preferences or whether these changes influenced broader social networks. This study addresses these gaps by explicitly measuring ideological rigidity and examining how dialogue influences participants’ attitudes within their communities.</p>

## Research Design
<p>In order to determine whether organized, moderated cross-partisan conversations lessen political polarization in American communities, this research employs a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate whether structured, moderated cross-partisan discussions reduce political polarization in U.S. communities. Participants (<em>N</em> ≈####) will be recruited from (how many? Or in each state) towns based on their self-identified ideological leanings (far-left, center-left, center, center-right, and far-right).<br>Following completion of a baseline survey that gauges affective polarization (negative out-group sentiment), ideological rigidity (resistance to changing policy preferences), and willingness to compromise, participants will be assigned to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Treatment groups: 6 biweekly, ##-minute moderated discussions in ideologically mixed cohorts (e.g., far-left/center-right, center-left/far-right). Curriculum that emphasizes active listening, collaborative problem-solving, and non-combative disagreement on contentious issues (such as immigration or healthcare) will be followed by groups of participants</li>
<li>Control groups: No discussions, but equivalent survey completion incentives.</li>
</ul>
<p>Trained moderators will use techniques from dialogue facilitation research (e.g., setting mutual respect norms, reframing adversarial language) to prevent unproductive conflict. Post-intervention, an endline survey will re-assess polarization metrics, while follow-ups at 3/6 months will test effect durability.  </p>
<p><strong>Key Methodological Innovations</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Ideological distance variation: The design distinguishes how the effectiveness of polarization reduction is dependent on initial ideological divergence by comparing results across discussion groups with varying partisan gaps (e.g., far-left vs. center vs. far-right pairings).</li>
<li>Mixed-methods integration: Discussion transcripts will be qualitatively analyzed to determine the mechanisms (such as stereotype reduction and empathy-building) causing quantitative attitude changes.</li>
