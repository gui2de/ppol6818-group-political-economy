## Problem Statement
In the United States, the rise  of digital media and decline in local journalism has contributed to increased political polarization on both ends 
of the political spectrum.Many individuals now consume highly filtered news content—often from social media or partisan outlets—that reinforces 
existing beliefs and limits exposure to opposing viewpoints. This fragmented media environment contributes to a growing unwillingness to engage 
constructively with differing perspectives and  makes it more and more difficult for citizens to come together on political issues or be willing 
to learn from those who disagree with them, resulting in a decrease in general political participation  but also collective problem-solving in 
socio-economic issues. We believe that structured, respectful dialogue between citizens of opposing political views may help reduce ideological 
rigidity and improve grand political understanding. Thus,  we theorize that presenting citizens with an opportunity to converse with other 
citizens of varying political beliefs will allow them to come together and perhaps reach a consensus on certain topics, leading to a general 
decrease in political polarization.

## Research Question
- Can moderated conversations between citizens of different political views reduce extreme political opinions and polarization over time?

## Research Design
We will conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) across several US towns to see if organized groups of citizens, evenly split between left 
and right leaning views, can have frequent moderated discussions and come away with less polarized political opinions. Our intervention will 
proceed as follows:
1. **Baseline survey:** Prior to the intervention, a comprehensive baseline survey to all participants, asking them a series of questions to 
determine baseline political and ideological biases will be administered. 
2. **Intervention:** Participants will be divided into two groups: Control Group and Trial Group. All participants will be categorized based
on their political leanings (fat left, center left, center, center right, far right). 
- Structure of Treatment Group: Participants with extreme political views (far left and far right) will be mixed with participants of various
other political leanings. A total of 10 discussion groups will be formed, each consisting of individuals from two different political categories:
far left - center left, far left - center, far left - center right, far left - far right; far right - center left, far right - center, far right - 
center right, far right - far left. The size of group would be identical. 
- Structure of Control Group: Control group only includes participants with extreme political views (far left and far right) and engage in 
discussions only within their own political category. The size of control group will be equal to one discussion group in the treatment group.
- Discussion Format: Guided discussions on political topics and individual experience. Discussion will be held biweekly for three consecutive 
months (Total of six discussions per group).
3. **Endline Survey:** After the series of discussions has concluded, we will conduct an endline survey of all participants, asking similar 
questions as the baseline survey. We will compare these responses to the individual’s baseline and determine how much (if at all) their 
political beliefs have changed.

## Policy Implications
We believe hosting these moderated discussions will encourage citizens to have more open and honest conversations with their neighbors about political differences, an often taboo subject in social networks when there are known disagreements. Furthermore, most major news outlets promote one political agenda over the other, often villainizing the “other side” as not worth talking to, further dividing citizens on common issues. We believe most American citizens have more in common with one another than they suspect, and that promoting an open dialogue will create space for such commonalities to become apparent. Furthermore, we suspect both sides of the political spectrum will realize they are wrong on certain issues, opening their eyes to the importance of such conversations in getting closer to an agreed upon truth.

We expect different results to come out of different pairings of political categories. For example, a group made up of far left citizens and center citizens may be able to agree on more subjects than a group of far left and far right citizens. The difference in such results will highlight the challenges that come from extreme polarization over less extreme differences.

For citizens in the control group, we are expecting to see little to no change in political polarization compared to the treatment. It is possible there will be spillover effects from the trial group (someone coming home from a discussion and sharing what they spoke about with their family and friends).

Our goal is to reduce political polarization in communities by fostering empathy, shared understanding, and reduced ideological extremity through sustained cross-partisan dialogue.
