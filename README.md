# Can exposure to traditional media sources help those in the US who only get news from social media better identify misinformation?

## Overview
In modern democracies, the media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion on economic issues. While 
economic realities such as inflation, unemployment, wage gaps, housing price increase and growth rates are 
driven by complex market forces and policy divisions, the way these issues are presented in the media 
significantly influences how the public perceives them. Politicians often leverage the media to frame economic conditions in ways that 
align with their political agendas and expand their political capital [^1]. This strategic framing can 
amplify economic concerns, mobilize political support, and shift public sentiment, sometimes 
independently of actual economic conditions. As a result, public discourse may become detached from 
economic fundamentals, potentially leading to policies that fail to address the root causes of economic 
challenges. 

This research seeks to explore the interaction between media coverage, political influence, and public 
opinion on economic issues. Specifically, it investigates whether being exposed to certain media sources of 
economic issues would change individuals' perceptions on economy, shaping their attitudes and 
policy preferences. The data of this study is extracted from 
[ANES 2020-2022 Social Media Study](https://electionstudies.org/data-center/2020-2022-social-media-study/).

## Problem Statement
Many US citizens get most of their information on current events through social media sites like X, Facebook, and Instagram [^2]. 
The problem is that social media is rife with misinformation (unintentionally false information) and disinformation (intentionally false 
information), making it easy for people to believe false information, thus affecting their ability to accurately participate in US politics 
[^3]. This makes it easier for corrupt politicians to push false narratives in order to pursue particular agendas not 
in a citizen’s best interest.

## Theory of Change

We will conduct a randomized controlled trial of 3000 US citizens who identify as getting most of their news from a social media site. Our 
intervention will begin with a baseline survey to all participants, asking them to identify if several statements made on economic and other 
political issues are true or false. We will then give 1500 participants a free subscription to a traditional news source (AP News, New York 
Times, Washington Post, etc) and encourage them to read a number of articles a week. After a few months, we will conduct an endline survey with 
all participants, similar to the baseline where we ask them to identify statements as true or false. 

We believe that those participants who engaged in traditional media sources will perform better on the survey than they did at the beginning of 
the experiment, as well as perform better than the control group who did not engage with traditional media sources. We believe this intervention 
will enable them to better identify misinformation when they come across it on social media in the future. 

We expect to see a difference in results based on the participants, age, race, gender, and political beliefs. Studies have shown that those with 
stronger beliefs are more likely to fall for misinformation that confirms their biases, so the results of the intervention will likely be weaker 
as original beliefs are stronger[^4].
