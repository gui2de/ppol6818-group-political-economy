## Overview
In modern democracies, the media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion on economic issues. While 
economic realities such as inflation, unemployment, and growth rates are driven by complex market forces 
and policy devisions, the way these issues are presented in the media significantly influences how the 
public perceives them. Politicians often leverage the media to frame economic conditions in ways that 
align with their political agendas and expand their political capital. This strategic framing can 
amplify economic concerns, mobilize political support, and shift public sentiment, sometimes 
independently of actual economic conditions. As a result, public discourse may become detached from 
economic fundamentals, potentially leading to policies that fail to address the root causes of economic 
challenges. 

This research seeks to explore the interaction between media coverage, political influence, and public 
opinion on economic issues. Specifically, it investigates whether being exposed to the content regarding 
on economic issues on social media would change individuals' perceptions, shaping their attitudes and 
policy preferences.
