## Problem Statement
Many US citizens get most of their information on current events through social media sites like X, Facebook, and Instagram [^1]. 
The problem is that social media is rife with misinformation (unintentionally false information) and disinformation (intentionally false 
information). This widespread exposrue to inaccurate or misleading narratives making it easy for people to believe false information, thus 
affecting their ability to accurately participate in US politics and creating an enviroment where politicians can more easily manupulate public 
opinion for their own gain. [^2]. As a result, false narratives may shape economic debates, allowing corrupt actors to push agendas that do not 
serve citizens' best interests while further distorting the public's understanding of key economic and political issues.

## Theory of Change
- Research Question: Can exposure to traditional media sources help those in the US who only get news from social media better identify misinformation?

We will conduct a randomized controlled trial of 3000 US citizens who identify as getting most of their news from a social media site. Our 
intervention will begin with a baseline survey to all participants, asking them to identify if several statements made on economic and other 
political issues are true or false. We will then give 1500 participants a free subscription to a traditional news source (AP News, New York 
Times, Washington Post, etc) and encourage them to read a number of articles a week. After a few months, we will conduct an endline survey with 
all participants, similar to the baseline where we ask them to identify statements as true or false. 

We believe that those participants who engaged in traditional media sources will perform better on the survey than they did at the beginning of 
the experiment, as well as perform better than the control group who did not engage with traditional media sources. We believe this intervention 
will enable them to better identify misinformation when they come across it on social media in the future. 

We expect to see a difference in results based on the participants, age, race, gender, and political beliefs. Studies have shown that those with 
stronger beliefs are more likely to fall for misinformation that confirms their biases, so the results of the intervention will likely be weaker 
as original beliefs are stronger[^3].
