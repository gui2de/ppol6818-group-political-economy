## Overview
In modern democracies, the media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion on economic issues. While 
economic realities such as inflation, unemployment, wage gaps, housing price increase and growth rates are driven by complex market forces 
and policy divisions, the way these issues are presented in the media significantly influences how the 
public perceives them. Politicians often leverage the media to frame economic conditions in ways that 
align with their political agendas and expand their political capital [^1]. This strategic framing can 
amplify economic concerns, mobilize political support, and shift public sentiment, sometimes 
independently of actual economic conditions. As a result, public discourse may become detached from 
economic fundamentals, potentially leading to policies that fail to address the root causes of economic 
challenges. 

This research seeks to explore the interaction between media coverage, political influence, and public 
opinion on economic issues. Specifically, it investigates whether being exposed to certain media sources of 
economic issues would change individuals' perceptions on economy, shaping their attitudes and 
policy preferences. The data of this study is extracted from 
[ANES 2020-2022 Social Media Study](https://electionstudies.org/data-center/2020-2022-social-media-study/).

## Theory of Change
- **Input**: Exposure to economic content in different types of media 
- **Mediating Factors**: 
    1. *Framing Setting*: Media selects which economic issues to highlight and how to present them.
    2. *Partisan Influence*: Politicians and media outlets frame economic issues to align with their agendas, influencing public perception of responsibility.
    3. *Selective Exposure & Misinformation*:  Individuals engage with media that aligns with their views, 
creating echo chambers and exposure to misleading or sensationalized narratives about economic conditions.
- **Short-Term Outcomes**: 
    1. Certain economic issues such as rising prices of goods become more salient in public discourse
    2. Individuals perceive economic issues based on preexisting ideological biases and shift public figures to blame accordingly. 
    3. Public perceptions of the economy become more shaped by emotionally charged and misleading narratives
rather than objective. 
- **Long-Term Outcomes**: 
    1. Public discourse and political debates focus more on framed economic issues. 
    2. Economic policy preferences become polarized. 
    3. Voter behavior and policy support are driven more by media narratives than by actual economic conditions.
