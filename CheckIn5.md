# Literature Review

We are attempting to conduct an experiment on reducing levels of political polarization by hosting moderated discussion between citizens of differing political views. Before we begin our experiment, we have conducted research into past experiments also trying reduce political polarization through conversation in a number of different contexts. 

Most previous experiments have yielded positive results, showing that it is indeed possible to reduce polarization through conversation, even in more contentious moments in history (Rossiter and Carlson 2024). Such experiments employ a variety of methods, such as hosting conversations online to preserve anonymity, to creating discussion groups based on personal similarities but differing politics. 

For example, there have also been a number of drawbacks, such as the short-lived effects of such conversations. Many articles we have read on the subject report only seeing reduced polarization levels for a short period of time, ranging between a couple of weeks to only three days (Santoro and Broockman 2022). We would like to be able to push that even further and see if more frequent discussions can lead to longer periods of reduced polarization.

That being said, some studies highlight the need for conversing periods to be quick and short, and that experiments that went on for longer periods of time had less effective outcomes. This is concerning given our goal is to have biweekly discussions for a number of months, under the hypothesis that such a duration is necessary to truly have people change their opinions on some political matters. This previous literature shows us that this may hurt our experiment more, and we may see severe attrition by the end of the trial period of political conversations turn sour and participants refuse to continue. 

Another point of concern is the finding of Jong 2024, where they reported polarization levels only decreased on subjects the participants agreed on. It is very likely that if participants reach an impasse, no further discussion will be fruitful and polarization levels will remain the same. However, we believe both Democratic and Republican voters do actually agree on more subjects than they currently think they do, such as the economy and how government should be organized. We hope moderated discussions will reveal these similarities and break down polarization. 

Given our findings, we believe there is a research gap in testing the ability to reduce polarization across a more stratified spectrum, by testing the effects of discussions between far left, center left, center, center right, and far right identifying participants. Most research only goes as far as to identify participants as left or right leaning, but we hope to find differences in the effects of conversations varying on the degree of polarization one group faces from another.
